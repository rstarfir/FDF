# FDF
## 42Ã©cole entry graphics project
### This project is about creating a simplified 3D graphic representation of a
### relief landscape. Learning basics of graphic programming, and in particular how
### to place points in space, how to join them with segments and most importantly how to
### observe the scene from a particular viewpoint.

I used minilibx as a graphic library for my visualisation. Code was written in Ecole42 norminette code style

## Usage

make
